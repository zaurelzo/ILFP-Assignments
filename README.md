# ILFP-Assignments
Some of the assignments that I've done  during my exchange semester at Indian Institue of Technology Delhi. 
The name of the course was Introduction to Logic and Functional Programming. I had actually really enjoy this course and had fun playing with advance boolean algebra concepts.
You can find in each folder a short description of the assignment and code in OCAML
